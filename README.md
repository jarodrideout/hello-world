# hello-world
Initial code for this account. 
My name is Jarod Rideout, and I am a recent graduate studying at the University of British Columbia. I wish to improve my coding abilities and branch out my interests. For this reaseon I have started my own GitHub account. Wish me luck!
I love :coffee: :pizza:, and :dancer:.
